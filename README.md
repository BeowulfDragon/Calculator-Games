# Calculator-Games
Games I made for the TI-84 Plus CE-T when I was 15/16
These are the two games I made
RRPLUS is a russian roulette simulator.
RRINF is a module you can select in RRPLUS, which goes infinitely, only "shooting" by die roll, not by which chamber is being used.
TEST is better known among my math group as Crusade Simulator. It's a walking sim where you need to walk to a destination, with every step having a chance to kill you.
I don't stand by any stances or viewpoints that these games have anymore, I'm just uploading them as examples of what I have done with TI-BASIC
